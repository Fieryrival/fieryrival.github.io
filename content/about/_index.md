My world is pretty much split in two.

Half the time, I'm in a digital playground, looking for hidden flags and trying to figure out how to open doors that are supposed to stay shut. 💻

The other half, I'm trying to make sense of the 'offline' world—usually by reading up on the weird ways people organize themselves, move money around, and draw lines on maps. 🌍

Turns out, both worlds are equally confusing and fun to explore.
